        Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 [32] [1][33][34] to a Maharashtrian
        family.[35][36] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni,
        worked in the insurance industry.[37] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev
        Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They
        were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[38][39]

        Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a
        young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[40] He
        also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[41] To help curb his mischievous and bullying
        tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a
        famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young
        Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing
        him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing,
        but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was
        accepted at Achrekar's academy.[42]

        Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram
        Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many
        notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in
        Bandra (East).[43] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and
        evenings.[44] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put
        a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If
        Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now
        considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[45] He moved in with his aunt and
        uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[43]


        Sachin Tendulkar and his wife Anjali
        Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in
        local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin
        consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[46] Besides school
        cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club
        cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[43] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[47] In 1987,
        at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the
        Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that
        Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[48] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran
        Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of
        India.[49] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light
        pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior
        cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said
        nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[50][51] Sachin served as a
        ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[52][53] In
        his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken
        664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his
        friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one
        bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not
        out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[54] This was a record partnership in any
        form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in
        India.[55]

        In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior
        to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from outside Yorkshire.[1][Note 1] Selected for
        Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16
        first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[67]

        Early career
        Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[68]
        after one first class season.[69] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for
        the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him
        to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test
        debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by
        Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body
        at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[70] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose
        by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood
        from it.[71] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar
        made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul
        Qadir.[72] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari
        Srikkanth.[73] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without
        scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[74][75] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the
        youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to
        debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[76][77]

        The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests
        including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[78] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day
        games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[79] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14
        August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second
        Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat
        in the match.[71] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also
        wrote:[80]

        He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he
        displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side
        shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short
        deliveries from the English pacemen.

        Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the
        1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest
        batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth
        against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border
        at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[81]

        Rise through the ranks
        Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He
        opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls.[82] He scored his first
        ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[83][84] It took him 78 ODIs to score
        his first century.
